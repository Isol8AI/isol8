"""
Schemathesis contract tests.

Auto-validates all API endpoints against the OpenAPI specification.
Uses ASGI transport so no running server is needed.

With mocked dependencies, endpoints that require external services
(gateway, DynamoDB, Clerk webhook verification) are excluded from automated
fuzz testing since they cannot be meaningfully tested without infrastructure.
