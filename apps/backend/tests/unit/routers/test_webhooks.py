"""Unit tests for the Clerk webhook handlers — tenancy-invariant observer.

These tests focus on the defense-in-depth observer added to
``_handle_organization_membership_created``. The observer logs an
error and emits a metric when a new org member already has an active
personal billing row (a tenancy-invariant violation), but it must
never block the underlying provisioning — Clerk has already accepted
the membership at this point.
