"""Stable error/status codes for tenancy-invariant gates.

These strings appear in three load-bearing places:
  1. HTTPException detail.code values that the frontend pattern-matches on
  2. CloudWatch metric dimension `reason` values for ops dashboards
  3. Structured log lines for incident investigation

Treat them as a stable contract — renaming requires coordinated frontend
+ dashboard updates. New codes are additive.
