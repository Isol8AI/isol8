"""Idempotent Paperclip workspace provisioning helper.

Centralizes the (resolve email -> get_paperclip_provisioning ->
provision_org -> close httpx) chain so every entry point that needs
to ensure a personal user has a Paperclip workspace can call the
same function. Failures are swallowed and logged — Paperclip outage
must never break the calling code path (container provisioning,
user sync, /teams BFF).

Personal context only. Org context is owned by Clerk's
``organization.created`` webhook in ``routers/webhooks.py``; calling
this for an org owner would create a personal-shaped row and race
the webhook.
