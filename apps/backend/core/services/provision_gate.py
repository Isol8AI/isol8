"""Provision gate evaluation — single source of truth for whether an owner
can provision a container, and *why not* when they can't.

Both `/container/provision` and `/container/status` consult this helper and
return its structured payload on 402, so the two endpoints can never
disagree about the gate state.

This module also owns the two pure billing-state predicates that
``evaluate_provision_gate`` (and several callers outside the gate) need:
``is_subscription_active`` and ``is_trial_blocked``. They live here so
every site that asks "is this billing account currently usable?" hits
the same code path — see the call sites in ``core.gateway.connection_pool``,
``routers.config``, and ``routers.billing``.
