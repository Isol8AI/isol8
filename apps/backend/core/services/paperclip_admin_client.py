"""Typed httpx async client for Paperclip's REST API.

**Auth model** (2026-05-02 fix): every call that "acts as" a user
carries that user's Better Auth session as a
``Cookie: paperclip-<instance>.session_token=<signed-value>`` header.
Paperclip's Better Auth config (``server/src/auth/better-auth.ts``)
does NOT enable the ``bearer()`` plugin, so ``Authorization: Bearer``
is silently ignored — only the cookie path authenticates. Sign-up /
sign-in extract the ``Set-Cookie`` from Better Auth's response,
strip attributes (``Path=`` / ``Secure`` / ``HttpOnly`` / ``SameSite``),
and surface the bare ``name=value`` as ``_session_cookie`` on the
returned dict. Callers thread that string in as ``session_cookie``
for every subsequent admin call.

The two unauthenticated routes — ``sign_up_user`` and
``sign_in_user`` — hit Better Auth's public endpoints directly and
don't carry any auth at all.

Endpoint surface verified against the local Paperclip checkout at
``~/Desktop/paperclip``:

  - Auth (Better Auth): mounted at ``/api/auth/*`` in
    ``server/src/auth/better-auth.ts``. Standard Better Auth routes —
    ``POST /api/auth/sign-up/email`` and
    ``POST /api/auth/sign-in/email`` accept ``{email, password, name?}``
    and respond ``{user, token}`` with a Set-Cookie session cookie.
  - Companies routes: ``server/src/routes/companies.ts``.
  - Agents routes:    ``server/src/routes/agents.ts``.
  - Access / invite routes: ``server/src/routes/access.ts``:
      * ``POST /api/companies/{companyId}/invites`` — create a
        company-join invite (requires ``users:invite`` permission;
        the user behind ``session_cookie`` must already be a member).
        Body shape: ``createCompanyInviteSchema`` from
        ``packages/shared/src/validators/access.ts:12``:
        ``{allowedJoinTypes: "human"|"agent"|"both", humanRole?, defaultsPayload?, agentMessage?}``.
        Note: invites are NOT email-targeted — they're token-based.
        The returned ``token`` is the credential that any human can
        use to accept.
      * ``POST /api/invites/{token}/accept`` — accept an invite. The
        signed-in actor (Better Auth session) becomes the new
        member. Body: ``acceptInviteSchema`` —
        ``{requestType: "human"|"agent", agentName?, ...}``. For our
        flow we always pass ``requestType: "human"``.
      * ``POST /api/companies/{companyId}/join-requests/{requestId}/approve``
        — approve the resulting pending join request. The signed-in
        actor must hold ``joins:approve`` on the company.

Notable deviations from the original plan template:

  - ``mint_board_api_key`` REMOVED. Paperclip's REST API has no
    per-user board-key minting endpoint; board API keys are only
    mintable via the CLI auth challenge flow
    (``server/src/services/board-auth.ts``). The new auth model
    instead creates a Better Auth account per Isol8 user (see
    ``sign_up_user`` / ``sign_in_user``) and authenticates proxied
    requests with the resulting session token.
  - ``create_company`` body is ``{name, description?, budgetMonthlyCents?}``
    per ``createCompanySchema`` in
    ``packages/shared/src/validators/company.ts``. There is no
    ``ownerEmail`` field — the caller becomes the owner via
    ``access.ensureMembership`` on the server side, using the actor of
    the cookie's user (so for org-create we MUST pass the org-owner's
    ``session_cookie``, not the admin's).
  - ``create_agent`` sends ``adapterType`` as a top-level field separate
    from ``adapterConfig`` — they are distinct fields per
    ``createAgentSchema``.
  - There is no ``disable`` company endpoint; Paperclip only offers
    ``POST /api/companies/{companyId}/archive``. ``disable_company`` is
    therefore mapped onto the archive endpoint.
  - Paperclip does not honor ``Idempotency-Key`` headers today (no
    middleware/route handler reads it). The client still forwards the
    header when callers provide one so that future Paperclip-side
    support can be picked up without changes here.

**Important: ``PAPERCLIP_AUTH_DISABLE_SIGN_UP=true``.**

That env var (read in ``server/src/config.ts``, applied as
``disableSignUp: config.authDisableSignUp`` to Better Auth in
``server/src/auth/better-auth.ts:121``) is enforced by the Better Auth
library itself — when ``true``, the public ``/api/auth/sign-up/email``
route is rejected for ALL callers, including the backend. This means
production cannot call ``sign_up_user`` while the flag is on. The
deployment plan therefore keeps ``PAPERCLIP_AUTH_DISABLE_SIGN_UP`` set
to ``false`` at the Paperclip server level (Paperclip is on a private
subnet, only reachable through our backend, so the public attack
surface is closed at the network edge rather than at the Better Auth
layer). T11 (provisioning) is the one place in the codebase that
calls ``sign_up_user``; it relies on this network-level closure.
