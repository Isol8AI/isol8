"""Payout service: Stripe Connect Express onboarding + Transfer creation.

v1 launches with US sellers only. International support is post-v1.

Connect flow uses 'separate charges and transfers':
  1. Buyer's purchase -> Stripe Charge to the platform balance.
  2. Seller onboards via Express -> Connect account exists.
  3. Held balance flushed via stripe.Transfer.create() to the connected account.

This module owns steps 2 and 3. Step 1 (Charge) lives in marketplace_service
(Plan 2). The webhook handler (also Plan 2) calls back into this module on
account.updated to flush held balances.
