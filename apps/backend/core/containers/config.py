    OpenClaw's connect handler rejects role="node" handshakes whose
    ``device.id`` isn't in the container's trust store (the paired.json file
    under ``devices/``). Per-member desktop nodes each have a distinct
    Ed25519 key, so each distinct member's ``device.id`` must be registered
    here before its first handshake will succeed.

    This function is safe to call on every ``_load_node_key`` — it's a no-op
    if the ``device_id`` is already present. It's also safe to run
    concurrently for different members.

    **Locking (two layers):**

    - ``fcntl.lockf`` on a SIBLING file (``paired.json.lock``) serializes
      ACROSS processes. Not on ``paired.json`` itself because we rewrite
      via tempfile + ``rename``: an fcntl lock is bound to the inode, and
      rename replaces it — the lock on the old inode is orphaned while a
      concurrent writer opens the new inode and acquires an independent
      lock. The sibling lock file's inode never changes.

    - A per-owner ``threading.Lock`` serializes WITHIN the process. fcntl
      locks are process-scoped, not thread-scoped, so two asyncio-to-thread
      workers for different members of the same org could both pass
      ``fcntl.lockf`` simultaneously and race the RMW. Dropping this lock
      caused intermittent lost entries under concurrent onboarding.

    Both locks are acquired in the same order (thread → fcntl) so there's
    no deadlock potential — the process-scope lock is always taken first.

    Atomicity: the rewrite uses temp-file + rename to avoid leaving the
    file half-written if the process dies mid-write. The tempfile is
    chowned to uid/gid 1000 when running as root so the in-container
    OpenClaw agent (running as ``node``) can read it.

    Returns True if a new entry was added, False if it was already present.
