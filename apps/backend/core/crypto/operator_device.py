"""Operator device identity + connect-request signing for OpenClaw 4.5.

OpenClaw 4.5 replaced the flat "shared token = admin access" model with a
scoped auth system (see `src/gateway/method-scopes.ts` in the OpenClaw
reference). A client that provides only `auth.token` in its connect request
gets an empty scope set — the server clears self-declared scopes because it
can't bind them to a pre-approved identity (`message-handler.ts:438-595`).

To receive `operator.read` / `operator.write` scopes, a client must:

1. Hold an Ed25519 keypair (the "device identity").
2. Have its public key pre-registered in the container's `devices/paired.json`
   with the scopes it's allowed to claim.
3. On each connect, build the canonical v2 payload string
   (`device-auth.ts:buildDeviceAuthPayload`):

       v2|{deviceId}|{clientId}|{clientMode}|{role}|{scopes}|{signedAtMs}|{token}|{nonce}

   ...sign it with the private key, and include the signature + public key
   in the `device` field of the connect request.

Notes on the format:

- `deviceId` is the hex SHA-256 of the raw (32-byte) Ed25519 public key.
- `publicKey` is the base64url-encoded (no padding) raw public key, NOT PEM.
- `signature` is the base64url-encoded (no padding) 64-byte Ed25519 signature
  over the UTF-8 bytes of the payload string.
- `scopes` are joined by `,` (no spaces) and must exactly match what we send
  in `connectParams.scopes` — the server re-builds the payload from those
  fields and compares.
- The gateway `token` is embedded INSIDE the signed payload even though it is
  also passed as `auth.token`. That's the cryptographic binding: if either
  side of the pair (token or private key) is stolen alone, no valid signature
  can be produced.

This module deliberately has no ambient state and no I/O — all inputs and
outputs are explicit so the caller can decide how to load/store the keypair.

# Scopes granted to the backend operator device.
#
# We need `operator.admin` because the backend proxies RPCs like
# `skills.install`, `agents.create`, `agents.update`, `agents.delete`,
# `secrets.reload`, `cron.add/update/remove`, and `sessions.patch/reset/delete`
# from the frontend to the gateway — all of which require admin scope per
# `src/gateway/method-scopes.ts` in the OpenClaw reference. The authorize
# function short-circuits on admin (`method-scopes.ts:232`), so we keep the
# read + write entries for observability ("this device was granted these
# specific scopes") but admin is what actually unblocks every method.
#
# **Ordering matters for signature verification.** OpenClaw normalizes
# device-auth scopes via `src/shared/device-auth.ts:normalizeDeviceAuthScopes`
# which calls `.toSorted()` — alphabetical order. The paired.json entry we
# write to EFS goes through that normalization path
# (`src/infra/device-pairing.ts:254`), so the persisted form is
# alphabetically sorted. When the client (us) signs the v2 connect payload,
# the server rebuilds the same payload from `connectParams.scopes` in the
# order WE sent them, and Ed25519 verifies byte-by-byte — so we must send
# the scopes in the same alphabetical order to match whatever form might
# appear anywhere in the server's auth pipeline. Hence: admin, read, write
# (alphabetical), not read-write-admin as added originally.
#
# Original attempt used `[read, write]` only — principle of least privilege —
# but the frontend's skill install flow hit a "missing scope: operator.admin"
# error because `skills.install` is an admin-only method. Widened on 2026-04-09.
