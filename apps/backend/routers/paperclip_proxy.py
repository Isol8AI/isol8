"""Reverse proxy for ``company.isol8.co`` → internal Paperclip server.

Validates the Clerk session, signs the user in to Paperclip via Better
Auth (using the per-user random password we encrypted at provisioning
time), forwards the HTTP request to the internal Paperclip server with
the resulting session token, streams the response back, and rewrites
HTML brand strings on the way out. A simple sliding-window circuit
breaker opens for 60s if the upstream 5xx rate crosses 50% in any 30s
window.

This module owns the *router* only. The host-conditional dispatch lives
in T16's middleware in ``main.py``: when an incoming request carries
``X-Isol8-Public-Host: company.isol8.co`` (or the env-specific equivalent)
the middleware mounts this router on the request path; for any other
host the middleware passes through to the normal Isol8 routers.

**Why ``X-Isol8-Public-Host`` and not ``Host`` / ``request.url.hostname``?**
API Gateway HTTP API rewrites the upstream ``Host`` header to the
integration target's DNS name (the ALB), so by the time FastAPI sees
the request the original ``company.isol8.co`` is gone from ``Host``.
``api-stack.ts`` adds a parameter mapping that copies
``$context.domainName`` into ``X-Isol8-Public-Host`` so the original
hostname survives the integration hop. (We can't use
``X-Forwarded-Host`` for this — API Gateway HTTP API blocks parameter
mapping on ``x-forwarded-*`` headers with "Operations on header
x-forwarded-host are restricted".) Starlette's ``request.url.hostname``
reflects the rewritten ``Host`` (the ALB DNS) — useless for dispatch.
Reading the custom header directly is the supported path.

**Auth model (v1, no session caching).**
Every proxied request signs the user in to Paperclip from scratch:

1. Validate the Clerk JWT (standard ``get_current_user`` dep).
2. Look up the user's ``PaperclipCompany`` row, decrypt the stored
   password.
3. Call ``admin_client.sign_in_user(email, password)`` to get a
   fresh Better Auth session token. Better Auth verifies the password
   with bcrypt server-side; the call is dominated by network RTT
   (single-digit ms inside the VPC) — no session cache needed for v1.
4. Forward the request to Paperclip with
   ``Authorization: Bearer <session_token>``. Better Auth accepts the
   session token in either a cookie or the bearer header.
5. Forward the upstream's ``Set-Cookie`` to the browser, scoped to
   ``.isol8.co`` so subsequent in-page AJAX requests carry it on
   their own. (Useful for Paperclip's own client-side fetches that
   address ``company.isol8.co`` directly without going through us
   adding the bearer.)
6. If the response is HTML, rewrite the visible brand strings
   (``<title>Paperclip</title>``, ``og:site_name``).

V2 should cache session tokens (Redis or in-memory with short TTL) and
reuse a long-lived ``httpx.AsyncClient`` so we amortize the connection
pool. T14 keeps it boring: per-request ``AsyncClient`` is only ~1ms
overhead inside the VPC and lets us defer the lifecycle/cleanup
question.

**Circuit breaker.** A small sliding-window counter (30s window, 50%
5xx threshold, 10-request minimum) opens for 60s when the upstream is
clearly degraded. While open, every proxied request returns an HTML
"Teams temporarily unavailable" page in 503 — failing fast prevents us
piling load onto a hurting backend. The counter is in-process and
process-local; that's fine for v1 with a single backend task. Multi-
task fleets get independent counters which is the conservative
(slightly less coordinated) behavior — they all break and heal
independently rather than relying on any shared state.

# to ``company-dev.isol8.co``, so this proxy never sees it on top-level page
# loads. (Verified empirically: signed-in browser fetch to ``company-dev``
# with ``credentials: 'include'`` carried no ``__session`` cookie.)
#
# Goosetown solves the same problem implicitly — it serves its own SPA on
# ``dev.goosetown.isol8.co`` that loads the Clerk SDK, and the SDK recovers
# the user's session via third-party cookies on Clerk's frontend API host

    Mirrors Goosetown's pattern: a tiny Clerk-aware page that mounts
    Clerk's ``<SignIn>`` component inline. After the user signs in (or
    one-clicks "Continue as ..." if Clerk recognizes the browser),
    Clerk establishes a session on company-dev.isol8.co, the page POSTs
    the JWT to ``/__handshake__`` to mint a host-scoped proxy cookie,
    then reloads — the next request carries the cookie and proxies
    through to Paperclip normally.

    Why we mount the sign-in inline instead of redirecting to a Clerk-
    hosted sign-in page: ``Clerk.redirectToSignIn`` defaults to a
    relative ``/sign-in`` URL on the *current* host, which is this same
    bootstrap page — that creates an infinite redirect loop. Mounting
    inline avoids the loop entirely and matches the Goosetown UX (no
    domain-bouncing during sign-in).

    Why we don't use ``__client``-cookie session sharing: Clerk's dev
    tier scopes session cookies per-application-host. The user has to
    establish a session on this host directly. Clerk dev does still
    recognize the email and offers "Continue as ..." with one click on
    re-visit, so the UX is close to "shared auth" without paying for
    Clerk Pro's cross-domain SSO.

# WebSocket relay — paired upstream WS for Paperclip live-events
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Why a separate route from the HTTP one?
#
# 1. **Auth source.** Browser-issued WebSocket upgrades cannot carry an
#    ``Authorization: Bearer`` header (the WebSocket JS API has no hook
#    for it), so the only credential we get is the Clerk session cookie
#    that already rides along on cross-origin requests to ``*.isol8.co``.
#    That means we can't use ``Depends(get_current_user)`` here — we
#    have to read ``websocket.cookies`` and validate the JWT manually
#    via ``_decode_token``.
# 2. **Different transport.** httpx can't proxy a WebSocket upgrade,
#    and FastAPI dispatches WS upgrades to ``@router.websocket(...)``
#    routes, not ``@router.api_route(...)`` ones. Both can register the
#    same ``{path:path}`` because Starlette's matcher checks the
#    ``websocket.scope["type"]`` and routes accordingly.
#
# Auth flow (mirrors the HTTP path's sign-in):
#   1. Read ``__session`` cookie (Clerk's default JWT cookie name).
#   2. Decode + validate with ``_decode_token`` → extract ``sub`` + ``email``.
#   3. Look up the user's PaperclipCompany row, decrypt the password.
#   4. Sign in to Paperclip (Better Auth) → session token.
#   5. Open paired upstream WS with ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``.
#   6. asyncio.gather two relay coroutines (browser→upstream and
#      upstream→browser) until either side closes.
#
# Close codes follow RFC 6455 + the "private application" range
# (4000-4999): 4401 unauthenticated, 4400 missing email claim, 4502
# Paperclip auth failed, 4503 not provisioned. They're informational
# only — the browser usually just sees an immediate close — but they
# make CloudWatch traces readable.

# Max WebSocket frame size we accept from either side. 10 MB matches
# Paperclip's own server limit; bigger frames are almost certainly a
# bug or abuse, so we let the websockets library reject them upstream
# of the relay loop.
