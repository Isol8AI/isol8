"""Clerk webhook router.

Receives lifecycle events from Clerk (user, organization,
organizationMembership) and keeps internal state — including the
Paperclip mirror — in sync.

Verification uses the svix HMAC-SHA256 signature scheme:
  https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how

If CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET is not configured the signature check is skipped
(safe for local dev; must be set in production).

**Paperclip provisioning dispatch** (added in T12):

  * ``organization.created``           -> ``provision_org``
  * ``organizationMembership.created`` -> ``provision_member``
  * ``organizationMembership.deleted`` -> ``disable`` for that user
  * ``organization.deleted``           -> ``disable`` for every member of the org
  * ``user.deleted``                   -> ``disable`` for that user

Retry semantics: if provisioning raises an exception with
``retryable=True`` (``OrgNotProvisionedError`` always; ``PaperclipApiError``
on 5xx + 429), we enqueue a row in the ``pending-updates`` table for the
T13 cleanup cron to re-drive. Either way we return 200 to Clerk so the
svix delivery is acked — we own retries from this point onward.

Non-retryable errors (4xx state errors, programmer errors) are logged
and swallowed; returning 5xx would just have Clerk retry the same
permanently-broken event.

# We construct a fresh PaperclipProvisioning per webhook invocation. The
# httpx.AsyncClient lifecycle is bounded by the request — this is the
# only call site so the connection pool doesn't need to be shared, and
# constructing per-request keeps the wiring trivial to override in tests.
# T14/T15 (proxy router) will introduce a long-lived shared client.

# The canonical home for ``_PAPERCLIP_RETRY_KIND`` is
# ``core.services.update_service.PAPERCLIP_RETRY_KIND``. Both this
# webhook router (which enqueues retries) and the scheduled worker
# (which consumes them) read the same constant — keeping them in
# lockstep is the only way the retry cron actually picks up the
# rows we wrote. The import lives at the top of this file alongside
# the other ``core.*`` imports.
