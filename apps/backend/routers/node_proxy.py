"""
Node connection proxy — per-user tracking for local tool execution.

Manages dedicated upstream WebSocket connections for node clients.
Each connected desktop app gets its own NodeUpstreamConnection to the
shared container. Tracking is per-user (not per-owner) so that in an
org, Alice's Mac and Bob's Mac are independent.

State:
  _node_upstreams   connection_id -> NodeUpstreamConnection
  _user_nodes       user_id -> {nodeId, connection_id, owner_id}
  _node_count       owner_id -> int (active node connections)
  _patched_sessions session_key -> nodeId (in-memory cache)
