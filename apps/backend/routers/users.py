    # Note: no billing-account creation here. /users/sync fires from multiple
    # places (ChatLayout mount, onboarding, settings), and the caller's JWT
    # may be in a transient personal context while Clerk is mid-activation of
    # an org. Creating a billing row here would produce phantom
    # personal-context rows for users who are actually org members. Billing is
    # created lazily by POST /billing/checkout (the explicit "subscribe" signal)
    # which is also gated on require_org_admin, so only the first admin click
    # through Stripe Checkout ever writes the row.
    #
    # Container provisioning is also handled elsewhere (GET /container/status
    # + ProvisioningStepper) for the same reason.
