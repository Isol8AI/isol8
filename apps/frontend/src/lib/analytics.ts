/**
 * The single PostHog touchpoint for the entire frontend.
 *
 * Every call into the PostHog SDK (init, identify, reset, capture,
 * pageview, captureException) lives behind a function in this file, and
 * the React tree's ``<Provider>`` is re-exported from here too. The rule
 * is: ``import "posthog-js"`` and ``import "posthog-js/react"`` only ever
 * appear in this module — every other file in ``apps/frontend/src/``
 * imports from ``@/lib/analytics``.
 *
 * Why: the previous shape had ``usePostHog()`` direct in 14 components,
 * which meant "switch analytics provider" or "add a global property to
 * every event" or "stop sending events from a specific page" all
 * required touching every component. The wrapper existed but was
 * bypassed — the seam was hypothetical, not real (per Matt Pocock's
 * ``improve-codebase-architecture`` skill: one adapter is a hypothetical
 * seam, two is a real one). Routing every caller through this module
 * makes the seam load-bearing and gives PostHog one mockable surface
 * for tests.
 *
 * What belongs here:
 *   - User intents (chat_message_sent, subscription_checkout_started)
 *   - User-visible outcomes (chat_completed, channel_link_submitted)
 *   - The React Provider wrapper (``Provider``) for the app's root layout
 *   - identify / reset / pageview / init bookkeeping for PostHogProvider
 *
 * What does NOT belong here:
 *   - RPC-call-level events (backend HTTP activity goes to CloudWatch —
 *     don't shadow it in PostHog)
 *   - PII beyond identify-level fields (specifically: no message content,
 *     no bot tokens, no API key values — capture lengths / types only)
