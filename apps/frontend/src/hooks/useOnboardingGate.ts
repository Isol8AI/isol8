/**
 * Phase of the chat-shell onboarding/context gate.
 *
 * - ``loading``         — Clerk hydration + user/org context not settled yet.
 * - ``redirecting``     — User must visit /onboarding (either: never picked
 *                         personal/org, OR has pending org invitations to
 *                         accept). The hook fires ``router.replace`` itself;
 *                         consumers just need to render a loading shell while
 *                         the navigation lands.
 * - ``auto-activating`` — User has org memberships but no active organization
 *                         in this Clerk session (fresh login on a new device).
 *                         The hook calls ``setActive`` on the first membership;
 *                         the next render flips ``organization`` and the hook
 *                         transitions to ``ready``.
 * - ``ready``           — Clerk context is final. Safe to render owner_id-aware
 *                         hooks (useAgents / useBilling / useContainerStatus)
 *                         and to call ``api.syncUser``.

/**
 * The chat shell's onboarding/context gate, extracted from ChatLayout so its
 * state machine — and its critical side effects — live in one named place
 * with their own tests.
 *
 * The "block the whole shell until this resolves" rule (Codex P1 on PR #393)
 * is what prevents the personal-vs-org JWT race that produced phantom
 * personal billing rows in prod. The hook bundles the three orthogonal
 * conditions (needs-onboarding, needs-auto-activate, needs-invitation-flow)
 * into a single phase so consumers can't accidentally read just one and
 * miss another.
 *
 * The hook owns the side effects: ``router.replace("/onboarding")`` for the
 * redirect path and ``setActive`` for the auto-activate path. The consumer
 * (ChatLayout) just reads ``phase`` to decide whether to render a loading
 * shell or the chat surface.
