 * Hook for the teams BFF surface (`/api/v1/teams/*`).

 * Centralizes all Clerk-authenticated calls into the BFF so re-routing the
 * base URL is a one-line change. Panels in `src/components/teams/panels/*`
 * use this hook for both reads (SWR-cached) and writes (one-shot mutations).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { read, post, patch, del } = useTeamsApi();
 *   const { data, isLoading, error, mutate } = read<AgentList>("/agents");
 *   await post("/agents", { name, role });
 *
 * Note on rules-of-hooks: `read` calls `useSWR` internally, so it is a hook
 * itself. Call it unconditionally at the top of a component (the standard SWR
 * usage pattern). Do NOT wrap a `read(...)` call in a conditional.
 *
 * The SWR cache key is `/teams${path}`, which guarantees uniqueness per path
 * so different panels never share state.
