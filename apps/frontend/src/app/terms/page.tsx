        <p className="legal-meta">Effective date: March 24, 2026 &middot; Last updated: March 24, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the isol8 platform (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;), operated by isol8 Inc. (&ldquo;isol8,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;), you (&ldquo;User&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rdquo;) agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;). If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.</p>
        <p>These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and isol8 Inc. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>isol8 is an AI agent hosting platform that provides each user with a dedicated, isolated compute container running persistent AI agents. Key features of the Service include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Per-user containers:</strong> Each user receives their own isolated ECS Fargate container with a persistent workspace for agent configuration, data, and state.</li>
          <li><strong>Persistent agents:</strong> AI agents run continuously within your container, maintaining context and state across sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time interaction:</strong> WebSocket-based communication enables real-time streaming of agent responses and tool use.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-channel support:</strong> Agents can be connected to third-party messaging platforms such as Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp.</li>
          <li><strong>LLM inference:</strong> The platform provides access to large language models via AWS Bedrock for agent reasoning and generation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To use the Service, you must create an account through our authentication provider, Clerk. By registering, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration.</li>
          <li>Maintain the security of your account credentials and not share them with any third party.</li>
          <li>Promptly notify isol8 of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
          <li>Accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account. isol8 reserves the right to refuse registration or terminate accounts at its discretion.</p>

        <h2>4. Subscription &amp; Billing</h2>
        <p>The Service offers the following subscription tiers:</p>
        <table className="legal-tier-table">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Plan</th><th>Monthly Budget</th><th>Details</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Free</td><td>$2</td><td>No subscription required. Usage capped at $2 of compute per month.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Starter</td><td>$25</td><td>Fixed monthly subscription plus usage-based metering.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Pro</td><td>$75</td><td>Fixed monthly subscription plus usage-based metering.</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Billing is processed through Stripe. By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize isol8 to charge your payment method on a recurring basis.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage-based metering:</strong> Compute and inference usage is tracked and billed based on actual consumption. A markup of 1.4x is applied to the base cost of model inference and compute resources to cover platform infrastructure and operational costs.</p>
        <p>You may upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time through the billing portal. Downgrades and cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period. Refunds are not provided for partial billing periods.</p>

          <li>Circumvent or attempt to circumvent usage limits, billing mechanisms, or rate-limiting controls.</li>
          <li>Deploy agents that engage in harassment, generate harmful or deceptive content, or distribute malware.</li>
