        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to isol8. isol8 Inc. (&ldquo;isol8,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) operates an AI agent hosting platform that provides users with dedicated, isolated containers for running AI agents. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information when you use our platform and services.</p>
        <p>By accessing or using isol8, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of our services.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and authentication credentials through our identity provider, Clerk. This includes your user ID and profile metadata.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with the platform, including session activity, feature usage, API call frequency, and container resource consumption.</li>
          <li><strong>Agent Interaction Data:</strong> Messages you send to and receive from your AI agents, agent configuration settings, installed skills, and workspace files stored within your isolated environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing Information:</strong> Payment details are collected and processed by Stripe. We store your Stripe customer ID, subscription tier, and usage-based billing records. We do not directly store credit card numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP addresses, browser type, device information, and connection metadata required to maintain your WebSocket sessions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Provide and operate the service:</strong> Provision your dedicated containers, maintain WebSocket connections, execute agent interactions, and deliver platform functionality.</li>
          <li><strong>Process billing:</strong> Calculate usage-based charges, manage subscriptions, process payments through Stripe, and maintain accurate billing records.</li>
          <li><strong>Improve the platform:</strong> Analyze aggregate usage patterns to improve performance, reliability, and user experience. We use anonymized and aggregated data for this purpose.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensure security:</strong> Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and unauthorized access to your account and containers.</li>
          <li><strong>Communicate with you:</strong> Send service-related notifications, respond to support requests, and provide important updates about your account or our policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously and employ industry-standard measures to protect it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Our platform runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure, leveraging their enterprise-grade physical and network security controls.</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> All stored data, including database contents, file system volumes, and secrets, is encrypted at rest using AWS KMS-managed encryption keys.</li>
          <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers, and between internal services, is encrypted using TLS.</li>
          <li><strong>Per-user isolation:</strong> Each user receives a dedicated, isolated container environment on AWS ECS Fargate. Your agent workspaces are stored on dedicated EFS access points, ensuring complete separation from other users&rsquo; data.</li>
          <li><strong>Secrets management:</strong> Sensitive credentials and API keys are stored using AWS Secrets Manager with envelope encryption.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. AI &amp; Agent Data</h2>
        <p>Your interactions with AI agents are treated with special care:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conversation storage:</strong> Agent conversations are stored within your per-user isolated workspace. Only you (and authorized platform systems required for operation) can access this data.</li>
          <li><strong>No model training:</strong> Your agent conversations, workspace files, and interaction data are <strong>not</strong> used to train, fine-tune, or improve any AI or machine learning models. Your data remains yours.</li>
          <li><strong>User control:</strong> You retain full control over your agent data. You can view, manage, and delete agent memory, conversation history, and workspace files at any time through the platform interface.</li>
          <li><strong>LLM inference:</strong> When your agents use AI models, prompts are sent to the inference provider (e.g., AWS Bedrock) for real-time processing only. These providers process requests under their enterprise terms, which prohibit using your data for model training.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We rely on the following third-party services to operate our platform. Each has its own privacy policy governing data handling:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clerk</strong> — Authentication, user identity management, and session handling.</li>
          <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — Payment processing, subscription management, and usage-based billing.</li>
          <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> — Cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, file storage, and secrets management.</li>
          <li><strong>AWS Bedrock</strong> — Large language model inference for AI agent capabilities, operating under AWS&rsquo;s enterprise data processing terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information to any third party.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account remains active and as needed to provide our services. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Active accounts:</strong> Your data, including agent workspaces, conversation history, and configuration, is maintained for the duration of your account.</li>
          <li><strong>Account deletion:</strong> When you delete your account, we initiate deletion of your personal data, agent workspaces, container resources, and associated records. This process is completed within 30 days, except where retention is required by law.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing records:</strong> Transaction and billing records may be retained for up to 7 years as required for tax, legal, and accounting compliance.</li>
          <li><strong>Aggregated data:</strong> Anonymized, aggregated usage statistics that cannot identify individual users may be retained indefinitely for analytics purposes.</li>
        </ul>
