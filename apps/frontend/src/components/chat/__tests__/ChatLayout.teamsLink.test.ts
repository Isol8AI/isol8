/**
 * Smoke test for the Teams link in ChatLayout.tsx.
 *
 * History:
 *   - PR #509 added the native /teams UI and a flag-gated <Link href="/teams">.
 *   - PR #510 removed the Vercel alias that kept the cross-subdomain
 *     Paperclip preview hostname pointing at the latest deploy.
 *   - But ChatLayout still derived a stale URL like ``${env}.company.isol8.co``
 *     and rendered it as the sidebar Teams link, which now points at a
 *     dead origin.
 *
 * Rendering ChatLayout end-to-end requires mocking Clerk, SWR, gateway,
 * agents/billing hooks, posthog, and the catalog — far heavier than what
 * this regression deserves. A source-level assertion is the most direct
 * way to lock in the fix: the file must not reference the retired
 * ``company.isol8.co`` host, and the only Teams link must point at the
 * native ``/teams`` route.
