// Ported from upstream Paperclip's issueDetailBreadcrumb.ts
// (paperclip/ui/src/lib/issueDetailBreadcrumb.ts) (MIT, (c) 2025 Paperclip AI).
// Upstream relies on React Router location state; in Next App Router route
// state is not a primitive, so the breadcrumb / header-seed helpers degrade
// to no-op stubs that preserve call-site signatures.
// See spec at docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-teams-inbox-deep-port-design.md
